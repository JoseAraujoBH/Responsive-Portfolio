                <p> Speed was a very important factor in the early 20th century. From Sergei Eisenstein, Henry Ford and the artists of Cubism and Futurism, speed was everywhere to be found. In the “Manifesto of Futurism” created and written by Filippo Marinetti, he mentions that new art in the modern world was inspired by energy, courage, audacity and the beauty of speed. Marinetti goes onto compare a racing car and its pipes to that of a serpent and how a roaring engine is beautiful. Eisenstein followed in the footsteps on speed by creating the Russian film The Battleship Potemkin. In this film, Eisenstein displays 155 separate images within one minute and twenty seconds. He created this film so that each image only flashed for about 1.6 seconds on screen. That is extremely fast for this time period.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Henry Ford was also very well known for speed in the early 20th century. Ford is credited with the invention of the assembly line production. He hired a man named Fredrick Taylor to work out the exact speed at which each worker should be working as well as which motions workers should use to perform optimally. Cubism, founded by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, was a form of art that decomposed their subjects into planes which converged into an angular maze, so that the viewer would wander throughout the picture. Picasso and Braque became so abstract with their paintings that they became indistinguishable and their subjects nearly disappeared</p>
